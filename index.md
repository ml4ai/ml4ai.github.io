The Machine Learning for Artificial Intelligence (ML4AI) Lab conducts research
at the frontier of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with
applications to a variety of domains, including automated assembly of
models from natural language and software ([Reach](https://github.com/clulab/reach),
[Eidos](https://github.com/clulab/eidos),
[Delphi](https://ml4ai.github.io/delphi),
[AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates)), and developing AI musicians
capable of collaborating and improvising with humans
([Musica](http://musica.ml4ai.org/)).
